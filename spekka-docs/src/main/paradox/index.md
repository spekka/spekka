# Spekka

Spekka (Streaming Productivity Enhancements for Akka) is set of micro-libraries focused on simplifying the development of streaming microservices with Akka.

The micro-libraries have no external dependencies apart from Akka itself, furthermore, to avoid conflicts, these dependencies are marked as **provided**, hence users are expected to explicitly add the relevant Akka dependencies themselves.

@@@ note
Spekka is released for Scala `2.12`, `2.13` and is build against Akka `2.6.16`.
Newer version of Akka `2.6` can be safely used with Spekka.
