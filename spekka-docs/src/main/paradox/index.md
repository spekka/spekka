# Spekka

Spekka (Simple Productivity Enhancements for Akka) is a library focused simplify developer's life providing out of the box patterns for common operations.

The library has no dependencies apart from Akka itself (to avoid conflicts, the dependency is marked as **provided** hence users are expected to explicitly add Akka dependencies).

@@@ note
Spekka is released for both Scala `2.12` and `2.13` and is build against Akka `2.6.16`.
